For whatever reason, I am unable to get onto any of the WynnCraft servers.
Whenever I try to get onto a server, all I see is the screen you get when inside a block.
I can't select classes or get on for that matter. This happens with all servers except 7.
On server 7, I am teleported into a small room that is 3 blocks tall, 1 block long, and 2 blocks wide.
I think it is made of black wool and has one white wool block on the wall.

Anyways, I cannot get onto any servers, and I really want to play with my friends.
